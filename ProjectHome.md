This is an attempt to implement the data structure/algorithm in groovy. I have been searching for a good implementation that takes O(n) time but found none. So I implement it myself and contribute to others by opening source it.

Although suffix tree is used mostly for string, it can be used for anything that has notion of sequence of finite elements. The code for this project is written exactly just that. So you are not constrained to use it only for string.
